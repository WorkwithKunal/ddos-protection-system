# DDoS Protection System for Cloud Environments

## Project Overview
This project is a DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) protection system designed for cloud environments. It aims to detect and mitigate DDoS attacks in real-time using machine learning techniques, ensuring the availability and performance of cloud-based services even under attack.

## Features
- **Real-Time Traffic Monitoring**: Continuously monitors network traffic for anomalies.
- **Machine Learning-Based Anomaly Detection**: Utilizes the Isolation Forest algorithm to detect unusual traffic patterns indicative of DDoS attacks.
- **Automated Mitigation**: Implements basic mitigation strategies like IP blocking and rate limiting to counteract detected attacks.
- **Real-Time Visualization**: Provides an interactive dashboard to visualize normal vs. anomalous traffic in real-time.
